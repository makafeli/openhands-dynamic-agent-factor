**User**:
Can you help define a set of multiple micro agents for openhands ai tool.  
Here is the GitHub repo: https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands  
And documentation: https://docs.all-hands.dev/

**Assistant**:
Below is a conceptual walkthrough...  
(*[Assistant provided an example of micro agents: TextSummarizer, LanguageTranslator, etc.]*)

**User**:
i wonder, is there like an agent that automatically builds/creates micro-agents based upon trigger words that is a just a technology stack keywords?>

**Assistant**:
Below is a conceptual outline of how you could build a “meta-agent”...

**User**:

**Assistant**:
Below is a basic working example of a dynamic agent factory...

**User**:
- can you look if there is a dictonary or somesorts that we expand the TRIGGER_MAP with?
- for the LLM integration we need to us the All-Hands / Openhands configuration page where you can define the LLM you want use and which model, it should integrate and use that page. This is the code on github of All Hands / Openhands: https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands

**Assistant**:
Below is an extended version of our dynamic agent factory example...

**User**:
can you export all the files for me in a zip file, and also put the chat we have in an .md file

**Assistant**:
Below is a simulated zip folder structure...
